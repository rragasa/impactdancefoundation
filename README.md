# Impact Dance
For nearly 25 years, Impact Dance has motivated, inspired and nurtured young people through hip-hop and street dance. Founded by Hakeem
Onibudo, the company has been a leader in the hip-hop, street and youth dance sector since its inception in 1995.

Through dance training, mentoring, creative performances and international projects, we enable young people of all backgrounds particularly
those less priveledged and considered 'hard-to-reach' to develop their creative and life skills, to discover their talent and grow up
to be 'fully functional individuals'; Impact alumini have gone on to thrive as, for example, professional dance artists, investment bankers,
radio presenters and designers.
